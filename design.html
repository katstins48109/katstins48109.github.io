<h2>Design Topic of the Month</h2>
<h3>5 Things to Consider About Usability Testing</h3>
<h4>Collect data in phases</h4>
<p><a href="#bordac">Bordac and Rainwater (2008)</a> had three testing phases for their website redesign project at Brown University. The initial phase gathered baseline data based on the usability of the existing website. The second phase involved focus groups and the functional and search prototypes. Individual usability testing and interviews of the functional prototypes were the final phase. This phasing enables you to make adjustments as you go and see how things have changed with the adjustments.</p>

<h4>See through the eyes of your users</h4>
<p>As <a href="#graves">Graves and Ruppel (2006)</a> outlined in their study, conducting usability tests allows designers to experience their projects the way their users experience them. For example, when looking through the lens of instructional librarianship, if a website or instructional materials are full of library jargon, their users might not understand what they’re seeing/learning. Conducting these tests can help identify the problem for the instructors so they can adjust the wording they use to benefit their students.</p>

<h4>Recognize the limitations</h4>
<p>As <a href="#lack">Lack (2007)</a> outlined, usability testing “should be used to help create intuitive, usable sites, not to test the need for or usefulness of a new service.” Designers should look to include multiple methods of testing when reviewing a project. There are a plethora of options to choose from, such as card sorting, focus groups, interviews, and questionnaires. </p>

<h4>You may not find what you’re looking for</h4>
<p><a href="#sonsteby">Sonsteby and DeJonghe (2013)</a> found that their students had trouble navigating through their LibGuide pages and wanted to find out if the tabbed interface of LibGuides was outdated or were they difficult to see (or was there some other issue). They performed two sets of usability tests on two small groups of their patrons (mostly students) and asked nine questions. At the end of their study, they found that they still didn’t have an answer to that question. They did decide that they need to test after the changes are made to their LibGuides.</p>

<h4>Adjust your project based on the feedback</h4>
<p>Users should take a proactive role in the design process. As <a href="#norman">Norman (1993)</a> suggests that you should start with your users’ needs and then build around it. You should start with your users’ needs and then build around it; however, <a href="#sugar">Sugar (1993)</a> found that first-time designers don’t often take user feedback into consideration when updating their designs. This is something they suggested should be addressed with additional training.</p>
