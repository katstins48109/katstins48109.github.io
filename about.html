<p>Starry Public Library is a small single branch library located in South Palo, CA. It was founded in 1977.</p>
<p>It's maintained by a staff of 5; the Library Director, 2 librarians, and 2 library assistants. The library is heavily influenced by the Star Wars world as developed by George Lucas.</p>

<h3 id="katie">Library Director - Katie Stinson</h3>
<p>Prior to joining Starry Public Library, Katie was a Senior Customer Success Manager for Boopsie, and then Demco Software, after their acquisition. During her nearly five-year career with the company, she represented over 400 library customers with a 96% retention rate and assisted with a 7% growth to her sales team’s territory. In 2016, she was awarded the Mariano Rivera Lazarus Award for the most saves and revivals of customer accounts.</p>

<p>The University of Michigan was where Katie’s love of libraries turned into a career prospect. While working the night shift at the Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library, she realized that working for a library could be a full-time career, and that there was even a degree that you could earn too! She learned about that too late in her time at Michigan and went the route of getting a degree in Latin American and Caribbean Studies (still a very valuable tool). Several years later, she’s renewing her passion for libraries in the academic realm and is now taking classes at San Jose State University's iSchool.</p>

<p>Katie believes that education and libraries are vital to the success of a community, which is why she finds peace working with libraries and library-adjacent companies.</p>

<p>Katie is a Michigan-native, now in California, and still makes several trips to the mountains for a snow fix. She has two lovable dogs and a mischievous cat, all alumni of the San Francisco SPCA. An avid reader, you’ll often find her with her iPhone/iPad/computer in hand with her latest eBook find.</p>
